OUR SCOPE OF SERVICES
We are travel and holiday organizers only. We inspect and select the services to be provided to you. However, we do not own, operate or control any airline, shipping company, coach or coach company, hotel, transport, restaurant, kitchen caravan or any other facility or provider etc. that is engaged to provide you services during the course of your tour. Therefore, please carefully note that, (1) you will need to adhere to the conditions, rules and regulations of each service provider. For instance, you will need to check the baggage rules of the airline to understand what kind of baggage and how much baggage you can carry. You will need to check the hotel rules to check what the mealtimes are, at which you should make yourself available. The company is not responsible / liable for the consequences if you breach such rules and regulations; (2) If you cause any injury or damage affecting the service provider, then you may be liable to the service provider and if the service provider recovers any monies from us for such injury or damages, we shall separately charge you for the same; (3) we cannot be held responsible / liable for any delay, deficiency, injury, death, loss or damage etc. occasioned due to act or default of such service providers, their employees or agents.
MEALS (IMPORTANT)
Please refer to the itinerary in the brochure / website for details of the meals which would be served to you on the tour. Unlike an airline, we cannot process a special meal, nor can we guarantee a special diet. The same is at the sole discretion of the service provider. We do not assure special meals or special timings or extra halts for infants, children, or passengers with diabetes, cholesterol, high blood pressure or any other condition. We cannot guarantee quantity of the food as may be provided by the service provider. If you have any such special requirements arising from medical conditions or from the needs of your children or otherwise, it would be advisable to travel on a customized tour and coach tours are not recommended. We, however reserve the right to change the meal arrangement, where circumstances compel us to do so. At some places a meal allowance may be paid to you at our discretion to enable you to have a meal of your own choice. There will be no fixed menu.
HOTELS
The Company selects hotels for your stay at locations, which give comfort and value for money. For various reasons, such as reducing the overall traveling time on the coach for the following day, the hotels may be chosen away from the city centre. Unlike other countries, most hotels in Europe do not have air conditioners or fans. Modern facilities such as attached toilets with showers / bathtubs are provided. We cannot guarantee the availability of adjoining rooms / interconnecting rooms / non-smoking room / rooms on the same floor etc. All baggage and personal effects are at all times and under all circumstances your responsibility. We will not be responsible or liable in case of loss of such items from the hotel premises / coach / cruise / airport / during travel or place of visit etc. Some hotels may offer the facility like safe deposit lockers, which can be availed of by you at your own cost and risk. The company will not be liable for any loss/theft from the same. Due to theft or loss of baggage, tour participant can lodge a complaint with the local authorities on his/her sole discretion, cost, risk and consequences. Any damages caused to the hotel rooms / coach / place of visit etc. during your stay/tour/visit, shall be borne and payable by you, and the company will not be liable for the same. Company is not liable if there is sudden disruption/disorder of telephone, internet services, and other amenities while staying at the hotels. Facilities like mini bar, pay television channels, telephone etc are not complimentary and these facilities if used by the client have to be paid for by the client directly to the hotel and such charges are not included in the tour cost. Hotels in Europe may / may not have room service facilities. The check in time is usually 2 p.m. and check out time is usually 11 a.m. In Australia, the check in time is 12 noon and the check out time is 10 a.m. In certain hotels like Genting Resorts, though the check in time is 2:00 pm, you may have to wait for some hours till the rooms are cleared. The same is subject to change from time to time. If you seek a change in rooming while on a tour, the same will be subject to availability and you will need to pay any additional charges as may be applicable. Please note that hotels in Europe and Far East can have exceptionally small rooms unlike what you may have experienced in other countries.
Single Accommodation
In case you book on a single occupancy basis, you will have to pay a single room supplement unless another tour participant is willing to share your room. You shall also be liable to pay the single room supplement if earlier having booked on a shared room basis, you later have to take the room on single occupancy basis since your intended room partner has either dropped out of the tour for any reason or since you and / or your room partner are no longer willing to share a room. Note that the single room supplement will be charged in all cases where a booking on a shared room basis has to be changed to single room basis including the following:
Intended room partner was arranged by you.
Intended room partner was arranged by us for you.
No room partner was found available for you.
Double (Twin) Accomodation
A double room has either a single queen-size bed or two separate beds. If you request for a room with a queen-size bed, the same would be provided subject to availability as most of the hotel rooms in Europe & Far East are twin-bedded. In case of non-availability of a room with a queen-size bed, a twin bedded room would be given.
Triple Accommodations
We recommend a maximum of only three persons in one room. Triple rooms are usually no larger than twin rooms and the third bed is often a rollaway bed or cot placed in a twin room.
Children Accommodation
A child travelling for whom 'without a bed' charge has been paid would not be entitled to a separate bed in the hotel. In case 'with bed' charge has been paid for the child and you decide not to avail such facility whilst on the tour, you would not be entitled to any refund. In case you decide to seek an extra bed for the child booked on 'without bed' basis on the tour, this will be provided subject to availability and you shall be bound to pay any additional amount charged by the concerned hotel directly.
PRE / POST TOUR / ADD ON EXTENSION PACKAGES
Pre / post tour accommodation / add on packages or extensions are available to you at special rates. You must ensure that you request your travel agent or your sales officer for the same at the time of booking your tour.
COACH AND SEATING
We generally engage air-conditioned / air-cooled luxury coaches but we are not responsible if the air-conditioning equipment malfunctions for any reason. On group tours, you are not allotted seat numbers as a seat rotation system is followed. You must follow the instructions of the Tour Manager in this regard. The average traveling time by coach is approximately 8 to 10 hours or more a day in Europe and in U.S.A. under normal road conditions. Comfort stops are provided every 2-3 hours, after appropriate intervals. The foregoing timings are indicative only. Though some of the coaches are equipped with emergency washrooms, such a facility can be used only in case of a dire emergency. The coach drivers are bound by restrictions concerning maximum driving hours per day and per week and the itineraries are planned with regard to the same. It is therefore essential that the itineraries, schedules and timings are strictly adhered to by you so as to ensure that all the services can be duly provided. If you or any of your co-passengers misses any service due to unpunctuality, we shall not be liable to refund any amount. Further, we shall not be liable to refund any amount or pay any compensation / damages for any change in itinerary or for missing any service due to the unpunctuality or actions of your co-passengers or for any delays due to any reasons. Please note that smoking, consumption of alcoholic beverages and snacks is strictly prohibited on coaches. Please keep the coach clean to avoid discomfort to yourself and other tour participants. Please take care not to leave behind any property in the coach while disembarking. The Company would not be responsible or liable in case of loss of such property under any circumstances.
BAGGAGE ON COACH
Please note that porter age is not included in the tour price. It is often difficult to get porters to assist as hotels may or may not provide this service and it is therefore advisable to use bags with wheels. Coaches have limited space for luggage and hence we permit only one suitcase and one handbag per person in the coach. The suitcase should be of a size of 158 cms. (width + length + height).
AIRLINES
We shall in no circumstances whatsoever be liable to you or any person travelling with you, for loss of baggage by the airline, failure to provide meal of your choice by the airline, denied boarding or down-gradation due to overbooking or any other reason, failure on the part of the airline to accommodate you despite having confirmed tickets, quality or quantity of meals offered by the airlines, flight delays or rescheduling, flight cancellation, changes of flight schedule or routing, change of airline mentioned at the time of booking etc. In these circumstances, we will not be liable for the injury, loss or inconvenience suffered by you but you will be free to pursue your remedies against the concerned airline.
BAGGAGE ON AIRLINE
Airlines have restrictions on the kind of baggage, number and weight of baggage that you can carry and you will need to carefully read and understand the rules and regulations of the airline, in this regard. Typically, weight restrictions on baggage for Economy Class is 20 Kg, for Business Class 30 kg and for First Class is 40 kg and one hand bag (cabin luggage) not exceeding 7 kg per person except for flights to USA and Canada, where the passengers are permitted to carry two pieces of checked-in baggage and one hand bag. In the case of low cost carriers are used by the Company during the tour, the permitted baggage allowance may be lower than what is mentioned above. Baggage is not included for internal flights in USA. One needs to pay for every piece of baggage checked in. The charges vary from USD 25 to USD 35 per bag. Please check with our sales staff for correct details. Please note that every airline has a different set of rules and regulations regarding the weight restrictions and furthermore, airlines keep changing the rules quite frequently. Hence, you are requested to please check the updated baggage rules of the individual airlines, with whom the ticket is booked. We are not liable / responsible, in any manner, if you are unable to carry any baggage or if you have to pay any extra charges due to restrictions imposed by the airline. You shall be liable to pay all such charges directly to the airline. Also, we are not liable / responsible for any loss or damage to baggage while it is in the custody of the airline.
AIRLINE DATE CHANGE BEFORE DEPARTURE
If you wish to travel in advance or return at a later date after the tour ends, then you must pay the applicable difference between the group airfare within the package holiday tour cost and the market airfare for the changed sector. The same will be quoted by us to you on your request. Over and above this you will also be required to pay an 'Airline Seat Rebooking and Reservation Fee' of Rs. 2,500/- or amount as applicable per person per sector, per change depending on the airline (subject to availability of seats and ticket validity). Please note that you will not be able to avail of the group transfers and accordingly you will have to make your own way to meet up with the group on arrival and / or to your next destination when your tour ends. We shall not be liable to refund any amount to you in this regard. Terms & Conditions shall apply.
AIRLINE DATE CHANGE AFTER DEPARTURE
It is absolutely necessary to have your return air seats to India confirmed prior to your departure from India.
If you wish to change the date of your return journey after departure from India, you will have to pay a 'Change in Reservation Fee' if any, directly to the airline, subject to availability of seats in the same booking class. This fee may range between USD 75 to USD 200 or more per person and we will not be responsible for the same.
AIRLINE CONFIRMATION AND RE-CONFIRMATION
Though you may receive a confirmed air ticket for a particular sector, airlines often overbook seats, due to which the airline may offload even confirmed passengers and may accommodate them on a subsequent flight. We will not be responsible / liable for any such offloading nor for any consequence of such offloading including delay, inconvenience or loss of tour services. As you are booked on a group fare ticket, please note that seat allotment will be made only when you physically report at the airport check in counter. You are advised to report at the airport check in counter at least 3 to 4 hours prior to the departure time. Seat allocation is a matter of airlines discretion and availability of seats is not in the control of Ezzy Journeys. Hence Ezzy Journeys shall not be held responsible if you do not get seats together or do not get your preferred seats. Please note that in case you are returning on a later date after the tour ends, the responsibility / liability to re-confirm air tickets 72 hours prior to the departure would be solely yours.
YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR DOCUMENTS AND POSSESSIONS
You will have to take the risk and responsibility of all your baggage, belongings, currency, valuables, documents and personal effects (collectively 'baggage') at all times during the tour, whether during travel on the airline or during your stay in hotel or during your travel in coaches, while on excursions or otherwise. If you forget to carry or if you lose essential travel documents such as passport, visa, tickets etc., you may be compelled to curtail the tour and you may have to incur extra expenses, for which you alone shall be responsible.
In view of what is stated above, please carefully note that:
We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage in respect of your baggage etc. or their contents whether due to theft, accident, negligence or otherwise.
We shall not be responsible for any cancellation or curtailment of your tour compelled by any such loss of baggage etc. and we shall pay no compensation or refund to you.
Some coverage in respect of baggage loss or damage may be provided by insurance (see below the Insurance section).
It is advisable that you do not carry valuables on the tour. However, if you carry any valuables, we recommend that you use all available facilities to keep them secure during your tour. In this regard, some hotels provide Safe Deposit Lockers (which may be charged separately). In case of airlines, we recommend that you declare your valuables to the airline at the time of check-in and pay an additional charge, as may be stipulated by the airline, to make the airline responsible for valuables. Without such declaration, airlines can invoke limitation of liability protections provided in international conventions and laws. If your baggage is lost or misplaced at any time during the course of your tour, it is your responsibility to take all appropriate actions to file complaints with the concerned authorities, including police, airline office etc. Please understand that as the Tour Manager is responsible for the whole group of tour participants, he may not be in a position to escort you to lodge a complaint with the authorities, as it could compromise the convenience and time of the group. Furthermore, Tour Managers / Assistants / Escorts are assisting the tourists throughout the tour and are not responsible for tourists' baggage or any kind of personal belongings. On the entire tour the tourists have to be responsible and carry the baggage on their own. Instructions as well as information of the tour are to be followed in the group tours and the tour manager / company is not responsible for any instructions overruled by the tourists and / or its consequences.
TRAVEL DOCUMENTS AND CLEARANCES
It shall be solely your responsibility to hold valid travel documents and statutory clearances, to enable you to travel on the tour such as passports, visas, confirmed air tickets, insurance and medical insurance certificates and other statutory certificates including immigration clearance etc. Please note that your Passport must be valid for at least six months subsequent to the scheduled departure date of the tour. If you cancel the tour due to non-availability of the passport etc, you will be liable to pay cancellation charges.
VISA GUIDANCE SERVICES
It is necessary for you to ensure that you have the appropriate passport, which is valid for at least six months after you return to India. For guests travelling to Malaysia, please ensure that the minimum validity of the passport should be at least nine months after your date of return to India. Furthermore, you will be required to take the appropriate visas for going on the tour. We provide you visa guidance services for which we will charge you. Such charges may include not only the actual visa charge and costs incurred but also our service charge. Please note that UK and USA visa will have to be obtained by you directly; however we may assist you in preparing and submitting the visa application based on documents provided by you. Even if you do not get your visa, you will be liable to pay the applicable charges. If you already possess a visa or wish to do the visa / s on your own, you would be entitled only for the refund of actual visa / s cost and the portion of charges attributable to our service charges will still have to be paid by you. It is your responsibility to promptly furnish to us all documents required for application of your visas etc. latest by 60 days before the departure date. In fact, in the current scenario it would be far more prudent to furnish all documents at least four months before the departure date. Given the security concerns and the over-cautious approach adopted by embassies and consulates, visa processing can take quite long. Please note that we may receive documents submitted late but we are not responsible for rejection or non-receipt of visas due to inadequate or late submissions. You are required to furnish only genuine documentation. Granting / rejection of visa is the sole discretion of Embassy / Consulate and High Commissions. We only act as a facilitator for obtaining visas. You may be required to appear personally before Embassy / Consulate and High Commission for any interview(s) / providing biometrics. The Company shall under no circumstance be held liable or responsible for rejection of visas and any other incidental or consequential loss, damage, cost or expense. You undertake not to proceed legally against the company for such rejection of visas, unless there is a manifest error committed by the company. We would not be responsible / liable in any manner whatsoever for any clerical error done by the concerned Embassy / Consulate and High Commission regarding the name, attachment of wrong photograph, duration and type of visa (single / multiple entry) or passport number. We always use services of reputed courier companies for the purpose of transmission of passports to the Embassies / Consulates and High Commission and to our clients in various cities. We will not be responsible for any loss or damage whether direct, indirect, incidental or consequential caused due to transmission delays or loss of passport or documents in the course of transmission of documents by us to the embassy or to you or in the course of transmission of documents by the Embassy / Consulate and High Commission to us. We would however, make best attempts to trace your documents or assist you in obtaining alternative / certified copies of the lost documents. If you are unable to travel on the tour originally booked by you because either you could not get your visa in time or due to an error of the part of the Embassy / Consulate and High Commission an incorrect visa is issued to you, you shall have the option to postpone your tour to any other future date or transfer your tour to any other tour and in such case the amendment fee for shall apply, in addition to cancellation charges. Please note that if the rejection of visa is intimated by the Embassy / Consulate and High Commission within the cancellation period specified in the section titled CANCELLATION OF BOOKING BY YOU then the cancellation charges as appearing in that section shall apply. Please further note that for the purpose of ascertaining the applicable cancellation rates, the cancellation would be deemed to have been made on the date we receive intimation of visa rejection from the Consulate / Embassy and High Commission. Should you choose to re-apply after visa rejection, then you shall do so at your own risk and cost. If the visa is rejected a second time, the applicable cancellation rates shall be based on the date of receipt of intimation of the rejection of second visa application and so the charges shall be much higher than the rates which would have applied on the first rejection. Should we not receive any intimation from the Embassy / Consulate and High Commission either accepting or rejecting a visa application before the departure date of your tour, the maximum cancellation charges shall apply. It is made clear that the cancellation charges shall apply in addition to the retention of visa service charges. You expressly agree not to dispute the foregoing.
